Introduction
--------------
This folder contains the code library written for the Xiphos Board v1.0.
The board was designed by Darron Baida for his B.S. EE senior project at Cal Poly (completed June 2009).
This library was developed by Patrick McCarty and Darron Baida, but parts of it were inspired
by the PolyBot Board library written by Cal Poly Computer Science professor Dr. John Seng.


Contributions
---------------
Improvements/suggestions/feedback on the code are always welcome.
Contributions of new or expanded library features and working examples are also gladly accepted.
Please email your contributions to patrickjmccarty@gmail.com for possible inclusion in the mainline library.
All code contributions must be compatible with the X11 License.
By submitting, you agree to release your code under the terms of the X11 License (see LICENSE.txt).

Software License
------------------
The Xiphos Library and its accompanying example projects are released under the X11 License (aka MIT License).
Please see LICENSE.txt for the terms of this license.


Obtaining the latest version
------------------------------
The latest version of the library and accompanying materials can always be obtained from the Google Code SVN repository.
Google Code allows anonymous checkout access, so you do not need any user account to get the code. However, only approved
developers (those who have a history of good emailed contributions) will be given write access to check modifications back in.

The url for the trunk folder of the SVN repository is:
http://cprc-xiphos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

So if you are using a commandline SVN client, you could type:
svn checkout http://cprc-xiphos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ Xiphos

Or if you already have an older checkout, you can simply update it:
svn update

The Google Code project can also be browsed at: http://code.google.com/p/cprc-xiphos/


Documentation
---------------
The entire library contains Doxygen-style comments, allowing documentation to be automatically generated from the source code.
You can view this documentation at: http://robotics.ee.calpoly.edu/xiphosdocs/
Or you can generate it yourself by installing Doxygen and Graphviz and loading the Doxyfile found in the XiphosLibrary folder.
